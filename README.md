Welcome to my machine learning repository! Here, I document and share my learning progress through various projects, experiments, and code examples. 
I started learning machine learning on 11 Februray 2025, and I continuously add new code and notes as I learn more.

This repository is a collection of my machine learning projects and experiments. It covers topics such as:
- Data preprocessing
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Deep learning
- Model evaluation and visualization

Each project is organized into its own folder with detailed explanations and code examples.

## Projects

Some of the projects you'll find in this repository include:

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Scripts and notebooks for cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data.

- **Supervised Learning:**  
  Experiments with regression, classification, and ensemble techniques.

- **Unsupervised Learning:**  
  Implementations of clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms.

- **Deep Learning:**  
  Examples of neural networks using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Tools and scripts to compare and assess model performance.

Feel free to explore the subdirectories for more detailed READMEs for each project.

## Installation

To run the projects in this repository, you will need Python 3.x and several libraries. The main dependencies include:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and/or [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) for visualization
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) for deep learning projects (if applicable)

You can install the required packages using pip
